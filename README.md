# Data and Analysis
All data and analysis are available here for reproduction and further analysis.  


## Analysis files
All analysis were conducted using RStudio, using the following packages: ggplot2, ez, tidyr, dplyr, purrr, lmtest, car, knitr.

Each experimental folder has a single analysis file (.rmd).  When the working directory is set to .rmd location, file can be run to load in all experimental data and reproduce analysis/plots.

A brief description of each experiment is provided below.

For each figure, we highlight the respective experiments included.  


## Experiments

A very brief description of experiments.  See manuscript for details.
### 10g2

Anisomycin given systemically after trauma.  A week later, animals tested in light-dark test, trauma memory recall, and novel stressor and subsequent novel stressor recall.  Note that although this experiment includes animals given anisomycin either 2 or 3 times after trauma, only animals receiving 3 injections of anisomycin are included in manuscript.  

### 10j10e3

Anisomycin in either the BLA (10e3) or vHC (10j) just after trauma.  A week later, animals tested in light-dark test, trauma memory recall, and novel stressor test and subsequent novel stressor recall.  Additionally, controls from these experiemnts given vehicle were utilized to show normative effects and relationships between phenotypes.  For main analysis, controls with vehicle in vHC or BLA were collapsed after being shown to not be different.

### 10k

Effect of inhibiting either BLA or vHC on light-dark test and novel stressor.

### 10k2

Effect of inhibiting either BLA or vHC on light-dark, open field, and elevated plus maze tests.

### 10k5

Effect of inhibiting either BLA or vHC during trauma memory recall.  Note animals also received uPSEM or vehicle with novel stressor at end of experiment (currently low N).
