# Data and Analysis
All data and analysis are available here for reproduction and further analysis.  


## Analysis files
All analysis were conducted using RStudio, using the following packages: ggplot2, ez, knitr, tidyr, dplyr, multcomp, MASS.

For each figure, we highlight the respective analysis (.rmd) and data files utilized.  Additionally, a brief description of each experiment is provided here.

#### Experiments
##### 10g2
Anisomycin given systemically after trauma.  A week later, animals tested in light-dark test, trauma memory recall, and novel stressor test.  
Note that although this experiment includes animals given anisomycin either 2 or 3 times after trauma, only animals receiving 3 injections of anisomycin are included in manuscript.
##### 10j10e3
Anisomycin in either the BLA (10e3) or vHC (10j) just after trauma.  A week later, animals tested in light-dark test, trauma memory recall, and novel stressor test. 
Additionally, controls from these experiemnts given vehicle were utilized to show normative effects and relationships between phenotypes. 
##### 10k
Effect of inhibiting either BLA or vHC on light-dark test and novel stressor.
##### 10k2
Effect of inhibiting either BLA or vHC on light-dark, open field, and elevated plus maze tests.
##### 10k5
Effect of inhibiting either BLA or vHC during trauma memory recall
